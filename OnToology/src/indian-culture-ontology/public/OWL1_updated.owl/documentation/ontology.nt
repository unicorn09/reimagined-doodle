They allow the wedding rituals to extend for a span of four to five days involving various programmes. There are two basic divisions of tribal marriage as followed in other traditions. If it is an arranged marriage, the groom has the liberty to express his expectations of his future wife. The parents then interrogate to determine the rector who helps to find out whether it is the inception of good spirit to marry. Sometimes the boy might elope with a girl and he is made to enter the village only after performing the sacrifice of their native fauna. This is usually done by the priest. The following events take place in Arunachal Pradesh wedding traditions. The three day events help to invoke affection among the couple. Day 1 – A grand luncheon arranged by the bride’s family followed by late night boogie and parties. The women who are in disguise of men enjoy the party along with the groom. Day 2 – The groom’s family reciprocate their love by arranging a grand feast. Day 3 – They celebrate the happy marriage by splashing coloured paints on each other.\n\n\n " .

The Assamese people also like to celebrate this occasion in a splendid manner. People from both the sides dress up in their finest traditional wedding attires, which adds to the traditional charm. The groom wears a traditional Dhoti, Kurta and Cheleng (a shawl of Assamese style), gifted by the bride’s family. The groom’s attire is traditionally accessorised by a flower and Indian Basil garland. The traditional dress worn by the Assamese bride is called Mekhla. Mekhla is generally created on Muga silk, and is adorned with gold and silver threads. Muga custom is specific to the state of Assam and a vital part of the tradition and culture of the state. This fabric serves as a good base fabric for Mekhla Chadar. Mekhla is a very interesting ensemble, which appears like a sari. Though originally a sari is a single piece of cloth, Mekhla comprises of two or three pieces of clothing. The first part of the Mekhla is worn as a skirt and the other half like an anchal of the sari. The fabric of the skirt part is heavy in texture, and is ornamented with a broad border and embroidery. In contrast, the fabric on the anchal part is light-weight and flowing. Mekhlas are designed in a myriad of colors like green, blue, yellow and red. Out of the many accessories used to adorn the Assamese bride, the jewelry is the most important. Gold jewelry is worn in contemporary or traditional designs. Some Assamese jewelry is made by hand, and is called Jun Biri. The traditional Jun Biri designs are inspired by nature, musical instruments and other Assamese household goods. This jewelry compliments the gorgeous Mekhla Chadar. Other accessories used by the bride include bracelets, bangles, nose rings, made with different metals and shaped in various designs." .

The saree and mekhla chadar are the key fashion element of an Assamese wedding. The wedding ceremony is known as ‘Biya’, in the Assamese language. Like all major traditional Hindu weddings, an Assam wedding also has pre & post wedding ceremonies. The ceremonies that constitute the Pre-wedding rituals are Juran, Tel Diya custom, Pani tola and Nuani. Juran – In this ritual, mother of the groom visits the bride’s house, and gives gifts to the bride and her family in a traditional brass plate called xhorai. Tel Diya – In this custom where the mother of the groom puts a ring and betel on the bride’s hair partition, and then oils it thrice, and puts sindoor. This custom culminates in gifting the bride with her wedding trousseau. Pani Tola – Collecting holy water for the Bride by mothers of both the bride and groom is called Pani tola.Nuani – This is tradition of taking a ceremonial bath for both the bride and groom. The completion of Pre-wedding rituals leads to a wedding reception for all guests, where they are served with splendid food. The groom side of the family then proceeds to a procession. Having reached the venue, both sides of the families interact and indulge in fun activities. The procession from the groom’s side has to pay a heavy price to gain entry into the bride’s home.  The groom is then welcomed with a lot of respect by the bride’s mother, and then having seated, the bride’s sister washes his feet. Afterward, bride’s brother lifts him up to take him take him inside the wedding hall. The bride is given a mixture of ghee, curd, honey, sugar and raw milk, called Panch-amrit, before entering the hall. The bride is taken there on the shoulders of her uncle. The wedding custom is then held in front of the sacred fire. The priest chants holy mantras, and the couple garland each other. Amidst the sound of conch shells being blown, the groom puts sindoor on the bride’s hair parting. The wedding culminates into the couple being welcomed at the groom’s house with a traditional aarti." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Bengal> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_dresses> "The dress of both bride and groom is purely traditional for a Bengali wedding and has an individualistic charm which has for centuries been mystical and exquisite. The wedding marks a new beginning for both the girl and the boy and both of them look their best at this auspicious occasion. Let us begin with the Bengali bride who is the center of attraction on her wedding day. The bride usually dons a Benarasi silk saree which is draped in a typical Bengali manner. Red is the color that is most popular when it comes to choosing a bride’s sari but other than red, colors such as maroon, magenta and pink are also common. The Benarasi saree is decorated with heavy gold or silver zari work and embroidery which only adds to the beauty of the charming bride. The Bengali groom is equally excited on his wedding day and dresses up in traditional Bengali attire. The groom wears a silk dhoti which is teamed up with a Punjabi, and he wears a topor on his head. The dhoti worn by the groom is either made from silk or cotton and earlier they were generally white, but these days the grooms don colored dhotis as well. The Punjabi of the groom is also made from silk and has heavy embroidery. Both bride and the groom in a Bengali wedding complete their traditional attire with jewelry. The bride wears heavy gold jewelry to complement her silk sari and her look only enhances with it. Some of the traditional ornaments that you will find on a Bengali bride are kaan or earrings, nath or nose ring, chik which is a heavy necklace, panch which is again a necklace and hathphool. Shakha-paula is also a vital part of the whole wedding outfit and it is a set of white and red bangles and also some gold bangles." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Bengal> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "The state of Bengal has always been popular for its rich culture and art and literature that prevail here. Bengali weddings are a huge affair and the people leave no stone unturned to make it a memorable one as well. The distinct style of Bengali weddings is not unknown to anyone and that is why people are keenly interested in knowing about the interesting customs that form a traditional Bengali wedding. Most of the traditional Bengali weddings begin with a ritual called Aiburo Bhaat and the wedding ceremony comes to an end with Oshtomongola ritual. The rituals that take place in a Bengali wedding can be broadly divided into three categories namely pre-wedding rituals, wedding rituals and post-wedding rituals. All the rituals have their own significance and meaning and are meant for a happy and blessed beginning for the newly weds. With time, the grace and tradition of a Bengali wedding is as it is and people still abide by the customs of their community.

In Bihar, especially for weddings, women wear ‘Seedha-Aanchal’ or front border. The saris are tied with the border pleated in the front rather than free flowing at the back. Since the borders are at the front, elaborate detailing is used, which includes floral patterns in adaptable color schemes like orange, green, red or pink along with side borders that may feature a solid color. The use of ‘Seedha-Aanchal’ plays a significant role in Bihari culture as it allows women to easily drape their heads with the ‘pallu’ or the side of a sari. Cotton and silk are popularly used along with georgette or chiffon. In regions like Patna or Gaya, bangles are excessively popular with females, who may adorn themselves with colored bala or Bali during the wedding day. Attar or perfumes are popularly used on the wedding day along with a range of ornaments like Chandrahar, Tilri, Panchlari, Satlari, and Sikri. Men’s wear is quite attractive and aesthetically appealing during wedding ceremonies as well. Kurtas and Pajamas are widely worn along with Dhoti and Lungi for rural regions. Luxuriating fragrances or Attar’ is popular with men as well. Milkmen in Bihar region are known for wearing ‘Kundals’ or earrings during a wedding." .

Saris have been popular for centuries, with women wearing them for marriages. Brides in Bihar dress up in saris that come in colors like maroon and red with golden patchwork or Zari embroidery. More often, these saris are complemented with Tikli or forehead adorning ornaments along with Bindi or a small round tattoo on the forehead (generally an accessory in maroon color that can be stuck on the forehead). For weddings, Tattoo Paintings or Mehendi is widely popular. Muslim women in this region generally wear burqas and Shararas- ( A kurta with flair bottoms). Men have been known for wearing Dhoti with kurta. Dhoti for a wedding is usually worn in white color with a designer border in different hues. Kurtas are plain with little embroidery close to the neck. Muslim men may wear Lungi or a single piece of garment tied on the bottom with kurta." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Goa> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_dresses> "A lot of the contemporary brides in Goa prefer to wear the traditional white wedding gown that is made out of luxurious and rich fabrics like satin and silk with delicate embellishments, along with the veil. The groom also dresses in a suit that could also be a tuxedo to compliment the bride.  The overall look is very classic, with a touch of contemporary designs. Women generally dress up in gowns and dresses inspired by Western designs and the men wear western-styled suits.  All the elements of a typical Christian wedding are present in a Goan wedding such as the bridal entourage that comprises of the flower girls, the ring bearer, the groomsmen, the maid of honor along with the best man. The traditional western live band and ballroom dancing are other elements that complete a Goan wedding." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Goa> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "A Goan Catholic wedding ha a set of rituals that are followed even now.  The Ros is much akin to the pre-wedding ceremony that takes place in other religions in which the bride and bridegroom are anointed with a special mixture called Ros.  Then this is followed by a ceremony called ‘Resper’ is which the couple are blessed in Church. Thereafter comes the big day – ‘Kazar’ or the wedding which is then followed by the wedding reception party or the Vor. A ‘white wedding’ is what can really be used to describe a typical wedding in Goa, however, the Indian tradition that provides a little twist to the ‘white wedding’ is the red dress/saree that is to be worn by the bride on the day preceding the wedding known as the ‘Saddo’. Another Indian ceremony called the ‘Chuddo’ in which the bride is to wear bangles. Goans are very traditional and even though the small state is strongly influenced by the western culture, yet the traditions and customs are a holistic mix of both Indian and western which make it very unique. A lot of the Catholic marriages and unions are sought through a matchmaker or a middleman who acts as a mediator between the two families. After the proposal is finalized and a decision has been taken from either side, the details of the wedding are discussed and this is known as ‘utor’ or promise. Next comes the engagement in which rings are exchanged and this ceremony usually takes place at the groom’s house. The bridegroom’s ring is placed in a special box that also contains a small statue of Infant Jesus along with some money from the bride’s side that signifies the dowry in which every denomination of Rs. 100 is taken as Rs. 1000 and the ‘yezman’ (an elder) is responsible for counting the money that amounts towards the dowry. The couple then files an application for Civil Registration in the Civil Registrar’s Office in the presence of their parents, two witnesses and close relatives. Then comes the ceremony of reading the three wedding banns or proclamations of marriage. Upon the first bann, the bride is invited for lunch at her maternal uncle’s house and this is when the chuddo ceremony takes place by the maternal uncle. The green and yellow bangles are to be worn without breaking a single one. After this ceremony, the bride is not to do any work as it is not auspicious to break any of the bangles, as they are symbolic of her wedded life ahead. A day prior to the wedding is the day of the ‘Ros’ ceremony in which the bride and the bridegroom are to apply ros (a mixture of coconut juice) all over their body, which is symbolic of them having left behind spinsterhood and bachelorhood. Another significant ceremony before the wedding is the Bicareanchem Jevonn which is a lunch that is in the honor of the departed family members of the home. For this, beggars are served rice and given some money. On the day of the wedding, the bride’s wedding dress and other accessories are sent by the groom to her house by a female relative who also helps the bride to dress for the wedding. When the calcada is being sent to the bride’s home, crackers are ignited by the groom’s side to inform one and all that it is being sent. Before proceeding to the church, the close relations and friends of both the bride and groom offer their blessings, and the groom is the first one to reach the church after which the bride arrives. On the wedding day, the dowry items are sent to the groom’s home before everyone leaves for the Church." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Gujarat> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_dresses> "Gujarat has a rich tradition of tie-dye textiles and the Panetar sari mirrors the same. Panetar is a unique sari of Gajji silk weave with a white body and red border. The white body may have linear stripes or checks in gold zari and is laid over with the regular pattern of red tie-dyed motifs. While originally, the border color of a Panetar sari was green, Gujarati wedding fashion underwent a change around the time of India’s independence that led to the introduction of the colors, saffron and orange. Later, red, the symbol of joy, became the preferred color for border, and remains so till today. In contrast to the Panetar, Gharchola is more complex in its fabric, texture and design. The cloth used to create a Gharchola sari is tied in Kutch, which is a region in Gujarat, before being shipped to Jamnagar where it is dyed. Woven using silk and zari thread, the Gharchola comes in a grid pattern outlined by zari and brocade work. The zari grids on a vertical row of a Gharchola are 9, 12, or 52. The woven Gharchola is then embellished with tied dot bandhini designs in a variety of themes like floral or religious motifs, and even peacocks. The sari is draped in a fashion that is typical to the region of Gujarat. The decorative end, or the pallu, is draped over the right shoulder, brought from back to the front in a pleated fashion. Groom’s traditional wedding attire is dhoti kurta along with a Bandhini dupatta or Achkan, draped around the neck." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Gujarat> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "A Gujarati wedding is an eclectic mix of tradition, colors and rituals that reflect the vibrant and rich culture of Gujarat. An elaborate affair, numerous pre and post wedding functions mark the celebration of a Gujarati wedding. Amid culinary delicacies, traditional dance or garba performances, timeless rituals, the essence of a Gujarati wedding percolates through the myriad of colors that don the marrying couple, their family and all their wedding guests. Like many other parts of the country, a Gujarati bride adorns a distinctive Gujarati saree on her wedding day while the groom wears the traditional dhoti kurta. The Panetar and Gharchola are two saris that hold immense significance in a Gujarati wedding. On her wedding day the bride drapes herself in a Panetar sari, which is a gift to the bride by her maternal uncle. The Gharchola, on the other hand, is given to the bride by her in-laws. Traditionally, the bride changes into the Gharchola at the end of the wedding ceremony, a custom that symbolizes her first steps into a new household. Today, it is common to find a bride drape a Gharchola chunni over her head as part of her wedding ensemble." .

While the turban stands out for the groom and all close male relatives, women drape beautiful dupattas over their dresses, which range from ghaggras, lehengas to salwar-kameez and sarees, depending on the community they belong to. The popularity of the intricately embroidered odhinis or phulkari which are available in magnificent colours is quite popular in certain regions of Haryana. The phulkari worn by the bride on her wedding day is known as Bagh (garden), in which design motifs of pat (thread of floss silk) cover the entire surface of the cloth. The tilli jutti is a renowned art form of the state and worn with pride by the groom and other men as part of the wedding attire. The colourful jutti is made from locally cured leather and ornamented with delicate silk, metal embroidery designs and beads. A unique custom of a traditional wedding in Haryana is the Khoria dance, in which women mime the entire wedding ceremony through their dance. They wear skirts with gold work on them and colorful dupattas; the jingle of heavy rustic jewellery adds its own melody as they perform. People of Haryana are quite fond of wearing ornaments. Mostly made of gold and silver, the traditional jewellery worn by women include necklaces (called Kathla in Jat and Mala in Bania communities), borla worn on forehead, various varieties of gold chains, earrings, traditional nose rings known as nath, and heavy weight bangles known as hansil. Jat and Ahir women also sport kari, pati and chhailkara on their legs. While the rich and affluent adorn themselves in gold fineries, silver still remains the ornamental choice for many." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Haryana> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "Weddings in Haryana, like in other parts of the country, are a vibrant mix of traditions and culture that has passed down from generations. Lehenga, Juttis and Turbans are the key fashion picks of the community. People of the state of Haryana practice their ceremonies, festivals and rituals with much pride and the dressing styles reflect the same enthusiasm and simplicity with which they approach life. The traditional attire can be described as simple and sober, which for men includes turban or pagri, dhoti, shirt and a traditional pair of shoes, known as jutti. One will find nearly all men wearing a blanket or chaddar over their shoulders. A key feature of men’s dressing is the headgear or turban; it is sported by certain castes of Haryana like the Jats, Rajputs, Brahmins, Banias and Ahirs. Women belonging to the Ahir community wear a distinct style of lehenga that complements a fitted blouse known as Angia, and an odhni. The odhni worn by Ahir women is different from that worn by Jat women. Historically, Ahir women used to work outside their homes too, and a broader odhni helped cover their upper body. The ahir odhni is most commonly found in colors of yellow and red. A decorative odhni worn during special events like weddings would consist of fringes along the border, supported by a fall on the inner side. The weddings in Brahmin and Bania communities showcase a strikingly different dressing style. A Sari, instead of a Lehenga, is the traditional dress for brides belonging to these communities. Men usually sport a dhoti, but strong sartorial overlaps are quite commonly observed with nearby states in the north region. Kurta Pyjama and Sherwanis are, therefore, other popular choices for the bridegroom." .

Silver jewelry is widely worn by Muslim women during weddings, while Hindu women may wear ‘Dejharoos,’ which has two gold pendants suspended through gold chains or silk threads that are worn and can be tied to the hair. This particular ornament is first worn during the wedding ceremony and later, it is symbolic of a woman’s marital status. Different varieties of dresses are popular during Kashmiri weddings. For instance, in Dogra tribes, women wear fitted pajamas with tunics or kameez that features full sleeves along with intricate color patterns on the borders, such as maroon, green and blue.

Quintessentially, weddings in Kashmir, especially the ones that follow Islamic traditions are a blend of Iranian, Turkish and Indian dressing styles which make these weddings a pure delight. The outfits, which have evolved over the years see a more contemporary version in Hindu weddings, but the idea behind them is still the same with women and men wearing ‘Pherans’ which are stylish as well as practical for the colder regions like Kashmir. These are accessorized with ‘Shawls’ or winter scarves that are exquisitely adorned with intricate hand woven patterns in embroidered style. It is the shawl’s fabric and design that reflects the family’s wealth." .

The state, which is renowned for its Tussar Silk has designers who weave these beautiful, embroidered saris. Panchi and Parhan is also popular among several tribes, with Parhan serving as the lower garment and Panchi serving as the upper garment. Since silk saris have their own unique lustrous texture, they are widely popular among brides. Mostly, they don’t have much embroideries or borders except on the pallu. The pleats formed by these saris are figure flattering and therefore the bride looks her best on the wedding. Recently, Anjana and Swarnarekha silk has also become popular with brides flaunting themselves in the sleek and sheen of these innovative, yet ethnically designed dresses. Accessories like gold and silver beaded ornaments are used to complement the ensemble. Perfumes and their aromatic presence are never forgotten, especially on wedding day. The sophistication and magnificence of these weddings in reflected in the pristine and perfect Bhagwan or dhotis, which are used on the wedding day. The present generation may also prefer outfits like Kurta and pajama as they are more comfortable and have more scope for design innovations and use of different styles and techniques." .

But simple doesn’t mean that the dresses aren’t rich or classy in terms of sophistication. In fact, Jharkhand is known for some of the finest quality of silk in India. The jubilance in dressing is widely seen and people prefer to wear richly detailed, cultured ensembles for the wedding. Traditionally, saris have been used by females and dhoti Kurta or pajama Kurta have been popular with males during the wedding. Vibrant hues used for women’s attire beautifully contrast the immaculate white colors in male dressing ensembles. At times, even females prefer white for the wedding, with beautifully blended borders on saris in bright tones like red and green. Silk as a fabric is popularly used and the variety of silk used showcases the family’s prosperity and wealth. Since time immemorial, saris have been used as a major outfit all over the country. Jharkhand is no exception to yards and yards of clothing. In fact, some of the best saris all over the world are handcrafted and woven in Jharkhand. Popular for its silk varieties, Jharkhand Weddings mostly have brides wearing saris for events like Sangeet, engagement and Wedding. Mostly, color contrasting in shades like green and red, blue and red, blue and pink or orange and blue are popular for engagement ceremonies, but when it comes to wedding, most of the women wear a white sari with a contrasting red border that has been intricately crafted for added richness. Men on the other hand wear only a single piece of cloth for their wedding. Known as ‘Bhagwan, this single piece is like a dhoti and favored by major tribes like Paharis and Santhals. On the other hand, nontribals wear attractive looking Kurtas with embroidery for the wedding." .

After reaching Sanathong, the procession is taken back to the temple along the same route. Wherever the procession leads, the people make the offering of flowers, incense sticks, fruits and barti (small cotton balls soaked in ghee).

Therefore, you can see eager people looking for an opportunity to pull the cart.

The weddings for a Brahmin and non-Brahmin are always different in any kind of culture. The traditional customs involve various ceremonies that are performed at the said time and place. Usually, there is a Pre marriage celebration in some of the Kannada weddings, where the bride is welcomed into the groom’s family with a piece of jewelry that belonged to the ancestors. This piece of jewelry marks the entry of the bride to be. The marriage begins with the Naandi ceremony wherein both families pray to the God for an uninterrupted wedding. The mandap where the wedding vows would be exchanged is built in the home itself. The mandap is decorated with everything that marks the Kannada wedding. One would find drums and other musical instruments set to the beat of the wedding songs. The groom carries two sets of baskets, one with sari and jewelry while the other contains jaggery and coconut. This basket also carries the mangalsutra that the bride would wear. The marriage ceremony commences with the exchange of garlands. In the meantime, the mangalsutra is circulated across the seated audience to acquire blessings from the elders. The mangalsutra is tied after it is received at the mandap. The sapt’(seventh) fera is summoned after that. Post these ceremonies, the groom and bride are announced husband and wife by the priest." .

It is interesting to see how each wedding is in some way similar to the other but, very different too. The exchange of trays marks the finalization of the match in case of Nair and other weddings while fixing of the church and taking permission from authorities marks the finalization in case of Christian weddings. The Christian wedding marks its opening with an oil bath and sweet banana milk that both bride and bridegroom have. The bride then reaches the Church in the car sent by the bridegroom where they exchange their vows. A party before the marriage and visit to the temple to seek blessings opens the marriage ceremonies for the Hindu weddings. For the Hindu weddings, the ceremonies are conducted either at the bride’s home or in a large auditorium. First, the groom is welcomed by the bride’s brother before they sit at the mandap to exchange the vows. It is during the actual ceremony that they tie the Mangalsutra, apply sindoor and perform the rituals that complete the ceremony. The traditional Hindu wedding is divided between Nair weddings and the normal Hindu weddings. A very typical Hindu wedding is basically very simple in both style and attire. During the marriage, there are few very important rituals and they happen to be common for all kinds of Hindu weddings. The tying of Thaali, the Kanyadanam where the girl’s father gives the bride to the groom, the giving away of clothes and, finally the drinking of sweet milk marks the various rituals of a typical Kerala Hindu wedding. In case of the Christian weddings, exchange of rings marks the completion of the marriage ceremonies. Signing in the marriage register solemnizes the marriage for both kinds of marriages." .

With colors, brightness and kaleidoscopic hues filling the environs, weddings in Madhya Pradesh are a visual spectacle that you can’t avoid. It’s the stylish ensembles, the comfort wear and universally fashionable outfits that give these weddings an edge over the others. For years, saris or a long 5-yard single piece of clothing has been worn during weddings in Madhya Pradesh. The marriage ceremony here is conducted in typical Hindu style and follows several rituals and occasion celebration that includes engagement, Shagun (a ceremony), Ladies Sangeet (a night when ladies dance and sing songs) along with the wedding day and reception a day after. The saris that have been used since medieval era includes a long cloth that is pleated and draped from the back, showcasing border design or pallu on the front side! This makes it easier to place the sari as a headgear. Over the years, saris have been revolutionized and modernized for designing Ghagra Choli, which features flair skirt of Ghagra in ‘A-Shape’ along with a Choli or long blouse, which is mostly embroidered with intricate detailing.

Let us talk about the attire in detail so that you can get a fair idea. The Marathi bride looks charming and graceful in a nine yard saree, known as the Paithani sari, which is vibrant in color and designs. The bride in Marathi weddings always dons traditional attire and the sari is draped in a typical Maharashtrian manner. The bride’s sari is generally green in color and is made from silk and usually it is either a Kanjivaram silk sari with a broad border in gold, or even a Benarasi silk sari. The hair of the bride is set into a bun and decorated with flowers. The Marathi people have a belief that a fully dressed bride is an avatar of goddess Parvati. The groom too dresses himself in traditional attire. He dons a dhoti kurta which is usually white in color, but some of the grooms also opt for some other lighter shades. He also has a stole around his neck which has a thin border in the color gold much like the border in the sari of the bride. The head of the groom is covered with a Nehru cap." .

The Marathi wedding is a good blend of Dravidian and Aryan cultures. The wedding process starts usually with matching the horoscopes of groom and the bride, and if they match then a date for the marriage is set by both the families. It has to be noted that a Marathi wedding always takes place during the day time as the Marathi folks regard the day time as the most fortunate time. The rituals for the wedding begin from days before the D-day and the engagement or Sakhar Puda as it is called in Marathi is the first pre-wedding ritual. The rituals that are done on the wedding day begin with a puja for Lord Ganesh so that everything goes as per plan and with the blessings of the deity. The traditions and rituals in a Marathi wedding have been the same since a long time now and people follow them as it is." .

The usual costume of a groom comprises of a white kurta, dhoti and he wears a turban on his head. The grooms belonging to santal tribe address to their outfits as panchi, matha and panchatat. The chakmas grooms generally wear a lungi teamed up with a shirt. The traditional outfit of a Manipuri bride is teamed up with jewelry but the only difference you will find is that a Manipuri bride does not wear too much heavy jewelry. You will observe that in spite of the fact that Manipur is regarded as the land of jewels the bride accessorizes with the basic ornaments such as bangles, nose rings, necklaces and earrings for her wedding day." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Manipur> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "The Manipuri community celebrates the wedding ceremony with a lot of joy and as a grand event. The process of the wedding generally begins with matchmaking and most of the Manipuri tribes are open towards inter-caste marriages as well. It is observed that the boys and girls get a golden chance to meet their prospective life partners at the New Year celebration. The wedding process begins with a ritual called Hinaba which refers to the first meeting of the parents of both bride and the groom. The horoscopes of the couple are matched at this ritual and the date for the wedding is set. Mangani Chakouba is the last custom of a traditional Manipuri wedding and this ritual is held after a span of five days from the wedding. There are many more interesting and meaningful rituals that are held in between this time. There are primarily pre-wedding rituals, wedding rituals and post-wedding rituals that form the entire Manipuri wedding. A traditional Manipuri wedding is a symbol of immense joy and the levels of it can be easily seen by the style of celebration. The Manipuri wedding is celebrated with great splendor and varieties of exceptional food is offered to the gods. The Manipuri people hold a belief that by doing this, the gods will be pleased and extend their blessings to the newlyweds." .

As a part of the tradition, a portion of the bride’s wedding attire as well as jewelry is given by the groom. The bride dresses herself in traditional Khasi outfit for her wedding day. She wears a dhara or Jainesm as it is known in local language. Both of these dresses are quite detailed and comprise of not one but several pieces of clothing, and hence give a cylindrical shape to the woman’s body. The Jainesm includes two pieces of contrasting fabrics, which rest on each shoulder. The bride also wears a crown on her wedding day which is either made from gold or from silver, and a peak is attached to its back. The groom too dons a traditional outfit for his special day which is known as Jymphong in Meghalaya. Jymphong is actually a long coat without any sleeves or collar, and it is fastened with the aid of two straps attached in the front. Now-a-days most grooms also team up their Jymphong with sarongs, and some of them also wear turban on their heads. Both the bride and the groom team up their wedding outfits with apt accessories for their special day. The bride accessorizes her outfit with various ornaments such as necklaces and earrings made from silver or gold. She also wears a gold pendant known as Kynjri Ksiar and donning an ornament on the head is an important custom for the brides in Meghalaya." .

Just like every community-based in India, the tribes in Meghalaya also have their own way of celebrating the joyous union of matrimony between two people. The traditional wedding ceremony in Meghalaya is unique in every sense of the word as it symbolizes matrilineal in which mother-line surnames are inherited. There are several tribes that call Meghalaya their home and Khasi and Garo tribes are amongst the popular ones. The Khasi tribes are in fact the largest and they largely follow the matriarchal system. Traditional weddings in Meghalaya are elaborate in nature and are usually preceded by an official engagement of the couple. A marriage is celebrated in Meghalaya only after both the families involved, agree to the alliance. The ceremony takes place at the abode of the bride and the couple exchange rings or betel nut bags. There is no existence of dowry system in traditional Meghalaya weddings. Both girls and the boys of the tribe have the liberty to pick their own desired partners and in some cases formal wedding ceremonies do not take place at all. The marriage is sealed once the groom shifts into the bride’s ancestral household. The Khasi tribes of Meghalaya have different customs and traditions which are unique in comparison to any other wedding practiced across the nation. The woman is regarded as the only custodian of all the wealth and the children of the wedded couple take the mother’s maiden name as their surname." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Mizoram> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_dresses> "Mizos mostly have a Christian wedding and hence the attire too is as per the wedding customs. The bride dresses herself in a white gown and almost every Mizo bride who gets married in a church dons a beautiful white gown for her special day. The head of the bride is covered with a veil and she holds a bouquet of flowers in her hand. The color white symbolizes virginity and purity and hence it is the color you will see on a bride who is getting married as per Christian traditions and customs. Some of the brides in Mizoram choose to wear their traditional dress of puanchei on their wedding. Puanchei is a spectacular dress which is donned by the girls hailing from Mizoram. This dress is a trademark on joyous occasions such as weddings and various festivals celebrated by the Mizos. Puanchei has been a part and parcel of the Mizo culture for a long time. Earlier it was only made by hand but today machines are used for the same. The fabric used is cotton and it is usually coupled with a white blouse. The groom is also the center of attraction on his wedding day and looks dapper dressed in a suit which is generally black in color as in most Christian weddings. There is no heavy jewelry involved in the wedding outfit of the bride as is seen in most Indian weddings. The bride mostly opts for silver over gold since that goes best with a white wedding dress. The groom too does not accessorize much on his wedding day. Simple and elegant is the tone of a Mizo wedding with little or no accessory." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Mizoram> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "Marriage payment is a popular trend that can be seen in a Mizo wedding. If you are wondering about the meaning of this tradition then it refers to the payment made by the groom to the bride’s kin. Mizo people are not the only tribe in India that follow the tradition of bride pricing in their weddings as there are some other tribes as well. The boy approaches the family of the girl and settles the price of the bride, and following that the wedding ceremony takes place. The wedding ceremony in Mizoram is generally predated by courtship and then engagement. The girl and the boy are given the liberty to know each other and form chemistry during their engagement period. Most of the Mizo people these days follow Christianity and hence their weddings also get solemnized in a church. A traditional Mizo wedding is quite different from the other community weddings you get to see in India. One of the most important traditions followed in a Mizo wedding is that a bride gives a Puandum to the groom which happens to be a traditional rug. This rug brought to him by his bride is wrapped around him at the time of burial. There are several types of Mizo weddings and these types differ as per the tribes that reside in Mizoram." .

The Angami tribal members tend to strangle a fowl and decide the fate of the couple on the basis of the posture which the fowl adopts while dying. The match is immediately broken if the fowl adopts an inauspicious posture. In Mongsen tribal community, the couples are engaged and are sent on a trading expedition. If this expedition turns out to be profitable then the marriage is fixed for them otherwise they are declared unfit for each other. There are many other practices which vary from tribe to tribe such as, in some communities pre-nuptial relations are allowed but not beyond a certain limit while some consider it as a taboo. In some communities, the groom has to pay a price for the girl in the form of a dowry and hence in those communities the girls are given a lot of care and regard. In some other communities like Sema, Lothas and  Changs a man can have multiple wives at the same time." .

The embroidery is generally in golden tones to match the gold jewelry that a bride usually wears for the wedding. Otherwise, it could be an amalgamation of colors which have various tones such as, wine, Mehendi, or Green to provide a contrasting aesthetic appeal to these beautiful saris. Brocade in gold is also popular, a style that draws its inspiration from South Indian Saris. Elaborately crafted headgear, which resembles a peacock feather, is used by both bride and groom. Over the years, wedding styles in Oriya have seen several innovations, including the use of Lehenga Choli, or a blouse with a flared skirt used by the bride during weddings. The overall global appeal of this outfit makes it contemporary and packs a traditional twist at the same time. Similarly, men have also tried innovative styles like Sherwani or Western Suits for the wedding, but the overall charm of Dhoti and the silk drape remains intact." .

With a generous use of elaborate artwork, including embroidery, prints and Zari, this attire is complemented with aesthetically appealing accessories, including necklaces, head accessory, earrings, nose rings and anklets. Made from silk, cotton, chiffon or Georgette, these saris are worn in rich colors such as maroon, red or orange to complement a bride’s skin tone and to reflect the richness and vibrancy of Indian culture. The brides also don an elaborate accessory known as ‘Uttariya’, which is a type of scarf draped across the saree. Men’s attire is as elaborate as that of women and the grooms are known for wearing beautiful Dhotis and shoes known as ‘Punjabis." .

Be it religious ceremonies, ritualistic occasions, traditional celebrations and many more adding to the list, this vibrant state sets the whole nation on a ride over the enriched roots of Punjab. Punjab is defined at its cultural best, when it comes to the celebrations of weddings and marriage ceremonies. This state has always been popular for its lively traditions and culture that binds people in brotherhood and unity. The food, rituals, dress, dance and many such entertainment aspects are richly followed in this state, which boosts up the ‘life’ of this state. The traditional wedding rituals of Punjab are divided into 3 categories, namely; pre wedding which includes Takha, Rokha, Mangni, Sagai, Sangeet, and Mehendi, which comprise the main wedding. Some other aspects of a Punjabi wedding includes pheres and kanyadaan. But the fun does not stop there, and a typical Punjabi wedding ends with a grand reception and a tearful vidaai, where the bride is sent off to her new home." .

Red being the most favored color of many Indian brides, they also go for colors like orange, bright yellow and appealing pink color costumes.  There are many pieces of jewelry worn by the Rajasthan brides to adorn various body parts. Rakhri is the bridal jewelry for the forehead, Timaniyaan is a choker studded with diamonds, Chooda is actually a set of gold and ivory bangles, Bajuband is an armlet bedecked with gold and stones, Bichhiya is toe-ring for feet and Nath is the nose ring made of stones. The lehnga choli worn by the Rajasthan brides is generally created with a silk base and embellished with coloured stones, semi precious gems, silken threads, traditional motifs and enthralling floral patterns with hand embroidery. The intricate embroidery work beautifies the Rajasthani wedding sari or Ghagra. Customary wedding attire is incomplete without an Odhni, which is a long piece of cloth, to be worn over the head. This Odhni is very heavily embellished and is worn over the sari on the wedding day. This rich piece of garment is treasured throughout life and also passed down from generation to generation.                  The grooms of Rajasthan get dressed like royalty for their wedding day. The traditional outfit of the Rajasthani groom consists of a long coat called Achkan with churidar and royal shoes. Their costume is highlighted by a turban, embellished with jewels or feathers. In order to tie the royal turbans, Pagribands are sometimes called in. Rajasthani grooms also sport a piece of jewelry called Serpech on the turbans. They also wear a long necklace and cummerbund around their waists, which makes them a royal and stately appeal." .

Some of these customs include the Tilak ceremony where the bride’s brother applies a Tilak on the groom’s forehead, as a symbol of respect and welcome. Then there is the propitious Ganapati Sthapana and Griha Shanti, where yagyas’ are performed with the intention of starting the wedding rituals with auspiciousness and removing any obstacle that could come in the way. The Pithi Dastoor’ is a custom of applying a paste made out of turmeric and sandalwood on the face and body in order to enhance the beauty of the bride and bridegroom before the wedding day. Janey is a custom where the groom wears a sacred thread around his body and performs a ‘havan’ in the presence of a priest. This is followed by the Palla Dastoor, an occasion where the groom’s family visits the bride and gifts her the wedding attire and exquisite jewelry, which is meant to be worn on the day of the wedding. Ultimately, these customs come to a grand closure with the ‘Baraat’, which is the marriage procession. The groom sits on either a horse or an elephant and makes his way to the marriage venue where he is greeted by the bride’s family and friends. Wedding customs comprise of Aarti and Saat Phere. On arrival, the groom is greeted by the female members of the bride’s family with an aarti, and is ushered inside by the bride’s brother.The actual wedding ritual is the Saat Phere, where the couple takes 7 rounds around the holy fire with the priest chanting mantras, and commit to the relationship of a husband and wife thereon. The post wedding customs of the Rajasthani wedding involve Bidaai, Grihapravesh and Pagelagni." .

If the water level decreases he predicts that there would be famine or less rain, and if the water level is normal, that is the signal of a good rain. Before pooja starts, the wife of the Pahan washes his feet and gets blessings from him. At the pooja, Pahan offers three young roosters of different colors to one for the almighty god â€” the Singbonga or Dharmesh, as the Mundas, Ho and Oraons respectively address Him; another for the village deities; and the third for the ancestors. During this pooja villagers surround the Sarna place.Traditional drum â€” Dhol, Nagara and Turhi â€” players keep drumming and playing along with Pahan chanting prayers to deities. When pooja is finished, boys carry Pahan on their shoulders and girls dancing ahead take him to his house where his wife welcomes him by washing his feet. Then Pahan offers Saal flowers to her wife and villagers. These flowers represent the brotherhood and friendship among villagers and Pahan the priest, distributes saal flowers to every villager.

This outfit, as it is a loose falling garment is fastened with a belt that goes across the waist to tighten the outfit and give it a more defined shape. With every passing year, even the city of Sikkim has undergone several innovations and transformations in every field, including cultural aspects. Today, westernization has taken over most of the traditional elements which define the ethnicity of the place. Modern ways of weddings, which include luxurious wedding venues and wedding outfits, have made an entry into its culture, which is nowadays majorly followed by its inmates. The concept of ‘white weddings’ have also come into vogue in Sikkim, which have attracted millions of Sikkimese residents. Generally the wedding gowns of Sikkim showcase multiple colors which are bright and radiant in features. But nowadays, plain white colored gowns which look similar to the wedding gowns of the Christian brides are donned by the brides of Sikkim. Gold accessories are now ethnically replaced by delicate costume jewelry, which match the outfits and are simple and exquisite in appeal." .

The sari is usually 9 yards and the color chosen for the bride is maroon. In the Non-Brahmin style of weddings, the bride is draped in a six yard saree which is made of Kanjeevaram silk. The colors are in a contrasting pattern. Gold jewellery is a must and, most of the jewelry is huge and traditional. The earrings are huge diamond studs that look ancestral and beautiful. The neck piece is also quite traditional with a tinge of modernity. A waist band is a compulsory tradition for the brides in the Tamil region. The brides of Brahmin origin would wear the hair in a bun style and adorn it with flowers. The brides on Non-Brahmin origin would either plait their hair or style up their hair to match the occasion. Flowers are compulsory for both the bride and those attending the wedding. The females in the wedding would wear the Kanjeevaram silk saris in bright contrasting colours. Kids are dressed up in pattupavadai. The groom wears a pattu (silk) veshti and an angostram (a silk cloth). The men are bare chested during the wedding rituals. The male members of the family are seen wearing a patuuveshti and either a kurta or angostram to cover their upper part of the body. The veshti is normally off white or cream in color with a colorful border. Though a lot of Gold jewellery is bought, interestingly each piece of jewelry is normally very traditional and interesting. The bride is never filled with gold in this wedding ceremony against popular beliefs." .

Most of the rituals that were conducted by a particular class are still observed by one and all. Most Brahmin weddings in the Tamil region differ in some ways from the Non-Brahmin weddings. The normal Tamil weddings would have a ritual Panda Kaal Muhurtam wherein both families go out and seek the blessings of the God so that no issues arise in the wedding. Vratham is a custom wherein both families observe fast before the marriage ceremonies are over. Nandi is where the families seek blessings from their ancestors, while Janavasam is where the bridegroom comes to the marriage venue in a car.

Vratham is a custom wherein both families observe fast before the marriage ceremonies are over. Nandi is where the families seek blessings from their ancestors, while Janavasam is where the bridegroom comes to the marriage venue in a car. Nichyadartham is where the bride seeks blessings of Lord Ganesha. This is also similar to an engagement ceremony. Also, during this time the groom’s family gifts saris and other things to the bride. In a Brahmin Tamil wedding the rituals followed before marriage would include Vratham, Nichyadartham, KasiYatrai and Janavasam. KasiYatrai is a typical Brahmin tradition where the groom decides to take Sanyasam and the father in law convinces the groom against it.  The wedding rituals are mostly the same for both the wedding cultures. Kanyadanam is an important marriage ritual conducted in a varied way in the lands of south India. Traditionally the marriage ends with a lot of games between the bride and the groom. Post marriage the families visit a nearby temple to seek blessings of the Lord." .

Each and every ritual in the wedding has a meaning and it has to be noted that these weddings take place mostly during the winter season. In all, U.P. wedding is packed with rituals that go on for hours and the fun never leaves the party." .

<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Uttarakhand> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_dresses> "The traditional Kumaoni or Garhwali bride would wear the traditional ‘Ghagri’ which is the skirt-like garment just like the ghaghra along with a ‘choli’ (the blouse) and the traditional ‘Pichora’ which is also called ‘Rangwali’ and is a traditional ‘odhni’ or veil that is embellished with silver and gold tatting’s. However, apart from donning the ghagri-pichora, the more conventional Uttarakhand bride prefers wearing a saree. On the other hand, the traditional costume of the groom in Uttarakhand is the dhoti-kurta or pyjama-kurta along with the traditional headgear for the weddings in Uttarakhand. On the other hand, the traditional costume of the groom in Uttarakhand is the dhoti-kurta or pyjama-kurta along with the traditional headgear for the weddings in Uttarakhand. Furthermore, the big gold nose ring called the ‘Nath’ is an absolutely necessary ornament that a bride needs to wear during the wedding and thereafter. After the wedding, the married woman has to wear a black beaded necklace called ‘Chareu’ (just like a mangalsutra) which is a holy ornament in Garhwali tradition. Some brides also wear a very expensive ornament called the ‘Hansuli’ which is like a solid single piece necklace in either gold or silver." .
<http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#Uttarakhand> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hp/ontologies/2021/2/indian-culture#wedding_origin> "Uttarakhand is predominantly covered by rolling hills and mountains with the Himalayas towards the North and the Garhwali and the Kumaoni ethnic communities which make up for the cultural richness of the region. Since they reside in the mountains and hills, therefore, their attire is also developed out of the climatic conditions and is therefore reasonably warm. Kumaoni or Garhwali weddings of the ethnic communities in Uttarakhand are very simple, although the various rites and rituals before, during and after the wedding are quite intricate. The traditional bride dons the typical Ghaghra-Pichora. The Pichora is perhaps the only part of the entire bridal attire that looks completely different and is a rich legacy that is passed on throughout generations. The Pichora has utmost importance in a Uttarakhand wedding and is akin to what a khara dupatta means to a Hyderabadi bride. The Pichora is traditionally hand-made as is dyed with vegetable colors after which it is printed by hand; however, a lot of machine-made duplicate pichoras are invading the market. There are only two colors that are used in the Pichora – red and saffron. They are considered auspicious colors in Indian culture. The red color stands for energy and conjugal life, while the saffron represents all the holy and worldly elements. The combination of these two colors brings in good luck to the bride for her married life ahead." .

Dhoklas are fermented which also increases the bio-availability of minerals present in food, helping the body assimilate more nutrition. The micro-organisms in the dhokla break down complex protein, carbohydrates, and fats into more easily assimilated molecules. Therefore, since healthy gut flora plays a key role in absorption, our body is able to absorb the maximum amount of nutrients, preventing nutrient deficiencies that are so common today." .

Ramadan continues for 29 or 30 days, depending on the lunar calendar of that year.  During the month of Ramadan, the routine begins a short time before dawn with Suhur which is a pre-fast meal for Muslims after which they do not have anything until dawn. For Muslims, Fajr is the first prayer of the day out of the five prayers Muslims perform daily. In Ramzan, this marks the beginning of the fast. Two more prayers are performed in between before the fast ends. After this, the Maghrib prayer is performed. At sunset, the first meal of the day is consumed and is called Iftar. According to the tradition, the fast is ended by eating 3 dates repeating what Prophet Muhammad did to break his fast. This is also a great time to have small get-togethers and have a buffet Iftar parties.Special nightly prayers called, Taraweeh prayers are held at the night and finally Isha prayers commemorate the day.

The Ramlila - an enactment of the life of Lord Rama, is held during the nine days preceding Dussehra. On the tenth day (Dussehra or Vijay Dasami), larger effigies of Ravana, his son and brother - Meghnadh and Kumbhakarna are set to fire.\n\nThe theatrical enactment of this dramatic encounter is held throughout the country in which every section of people participates enthusiastically.\n In burning the effigies the people are asked to burn the evil within them, and thus follow the path of truth and goodness, bearing in mind the instance of Ravana, who despite all his might and majesty was destroyed for his evil ways.\n" .

That was when Krishna came forward and lifted Mount Govardhan as an umbrella on the little finger of his right hand so that everyone could take shelter from the rain. Its because of this incident that he got the epithet Govardhandhari." .

The king then called for his sister Holika who was immune to fire to sit with Prahlad in a bonfire and burn him. Ironically Holika was burned by the flames and Prahlad came out unscathed. So this day is also revered as the victory of good over evil. While in other parts of India; Holi is related to Radha-Krishna and their playfullness.

This particular prayer is made up of two units called Rakats which is performed in a large hall or any open field. The one specialty of this Islamic chant is that it has additional 6 Takbirs in which a person has to raise his hands till the ears and say Allahu Akbar . For Sunnis, this process is done 12 times. Common greetings are exchanged on this day from Eid Mubarak in Arab to Bayaraminiz kutlu olsun in Turkey. Forgetting the differences and animosities and forgiveness is also encouraged on this day.\n\nIdeally, Muslims wake up early on this day and after their first Fajr prayer they can clean their teeth, take bath, wear new clothes and apply Itr or perfume as well.\n\nAfter this they are allowed to take the customary sweet date-fruit and go for their next prayer or Salat. This is often done on a wide open ground or mosque wherein they are not allowed to speak a word except that of the Islamic prayer. People ask for Allah s mercy and forgiveness.\n\nA common tradition of Eidi is very famous among the kids and children. Many even indulge in charity to show their happiness and help the poor.\n\n" .

The festival is celebrated for nine auspicious days with each day having its own special importance. There are special celebrations organized at Arunachaleswarar Temple amidst Annamali Hills in Thiruvannamalai. The celebrations begin with the flag hoisting on the Uttradam day and the festivity continues for nine Kathigai Deepamdays. The popular Bharani Deepam in five agantams is lit in Arunachaleswarar’s Sannithi in early morning hours of the tenth day. Devotees move to the Annamali Hills to worship the Bharani Deepam on the final day of the festival. It is believed that the flame of the lamp does not sputter on this day and divulge into the form of Lord Muruga, reaching up to the sky. The Bharani Deepam is actually a colossal circular metal vessel with a capacity to hold about 2,000 liters of ghee, a height of five and half feet and diameter of five feet. The wick of the lamp itself is made up of 30m of Ghada cloth burnt using 2 kilos of camphor. It is claimed that on the night of Karthigai Pournami , when the lamp is lit it can be seen across an area of 35km around the shrine.\n\nIn the evening, the Pancha Murthis are brought to the Katchi Mandapam. At dusk (Pradosham), with the Karthigai day harmonizing with full moon day, the deity, Ardhanareeswarar, is taken in a grand procession on the decorated vehicle to this place with the five deepams, which are put in a big receptacle near the flag staff. At the same time, the guiding light on the hill is lit and huge crowd raise cry in a loud voice \"Annamalaikku Arogara.\" It is a sight for the Gods! The lighting of the beacon on the top of the hill is the finale of ten days of merriment in the town.\n                                             " .

During this month, while on a journey, Hazrat Imam Hussain, his family members and a number of his followers were surrounded by the forces of Yazid, the Muslim ruler of the time. During the siege, they were deprived of food and water and many of them were put to death. The incident happened at a place called Karbala in Iraq in 61st year after Hijra. This dispute was a result of a disagreement among Muslims on the question of succession after the demise of Hazrat Ali, the fourth caliph. Some sects of Muslims hold meetings where speeches are made on the happenings of Karbala and on the lives of martyrs. They show their grief and sorrow by inflicting wounds on their own bodies with sharp metal tied to chain with which they scourge themselves. This is done in order to depict the sufferings of the martyrs. It is a sad occasion and everyone in the procession chants \"Ya Hussain\", with loud wails of lamentation. Generally a white horse beautifully decorated for the occasion, is also included in the procession, to mark the empty mount of Hazrat Imam Husain after his martyrdom. During these first ten days of Muharram, drinking posts are also set up temporarily by the Shia community where water and juices are served to all, free of charge.  " .

The brother in turn takes a lifelong vow to protect her sister under all circumstances and to always stand by her side. As per the traditions, the sister on this day prepares the puja thali with diya, roli, chawal and rakhis. She worships the deities, ties Rakhi to the brother(s) and wishes for their well-being.
