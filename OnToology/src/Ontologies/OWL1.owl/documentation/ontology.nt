This also contributes to keeping you fuller for longer and less likely to need snacks or overeat. Besides containing just the calorie secrets coming from brown rice, the presence of the two herbs ginger and garlic adds more on the flavor besides its medicinal properties. Also, adding more to its protein content is the split green dal making it a perfect cereal-pulse combination recipe.\n\n" .
